## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security report can be done by my E2EE signal link (username : wednesday.04) : https://signal.me/#eu/y8j2FU1WQVTP6HqS1brYjgBWD-BWCUx0o5Pq8mGkXtpVNNkFTEpMJ6kvkL2-B5e9 \
Thanks to provide any security issue you found, you will be credited on this repo (and maybe a special page on the website later).
